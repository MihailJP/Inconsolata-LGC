Inconsolata LGC
===============

Inconsolata is one of the most suitable font for programmers created by Raph
Levien. Since the original Inconsolata does not contain Cyrillic alphabet,
it was slightly inconvenient for not a few programmers from Russia.

Inconsolata LGC is a modified version of Inconsolata with added the Cyrillic
alphabet which directly descends from Inconsolata Hellenic supporting modern
Greek.
